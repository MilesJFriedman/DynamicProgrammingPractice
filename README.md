Problem A: SumsGiven N determine how many ways you can represent N as a sum of 3 numbers 2,3 and 5. The number of ways may be large so just output modulo M. Note that you are to count different orderings of the same set of numbers as different ways. See the example below for clarification.For example 9 can be represented in 8 ways.9=2+2+2+39=2+2+3+29=2+2+59=2+3+2+29=2+5+29=3+2+2+29=3+3+39=5+2+2InputThe first line of the input gives an integer T(T â‰¤100), which is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers N and M. N is between 1 and 10^5, inclusive. M is between 2 and 10000, inclusive.OutputFor each test case,output the number of ways modulo MSample Input:48 10020 12350 1234100 2345Sample Output:6795511186
